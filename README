# Live Reload with Live.js

This Tampermonkey user script facilitates **live reloading** during development on a local host using Live.js. It is an **easy-to-use tool** that ensures your local development environment **automatically reflects** recent changes in your code **without the need to manually refresh the page**. **Activate or deactivate** it based on the **port** you want to use.

## Features

- **Automatic Reload**: Reloads the web page whenever changes in HTML, CSS, or JavaScript files are detected.
- **Toggle Live Reload**: Easily enable or disable live reload through the Tampermonkey menu.

> **Note**: The option is disabled by default. When toggled, the state is saved in the local storage based on the port, ensuring persistence and a consistent configuration per port.

- **Status Notification**: Shows the current status (enabled or disabled) of the live reload feature.

## Installation

1. Install [Tampermonkey](https://www.tampermonkey.net).
2. Go to the [live_reload.user.js](https://github.com/TheShepsMT89/Live-Reload-with-Live.js/blob/main/live_reload.user.js) script.
3. Press the Install button.

## Usage

1. Start the server on the port where you will be working and navigate to your localhost address in the browser.
2. Click on the extensions button and select Tampermonkey.

4. To view the status or disable live reload, go back to the extension menu.

## Credits

- **Live.js**: The core functionality for live reloading is powered by [Live.js](http://livejs.com/), originally created by Martin Kool (@mrtnkl). This script uses a version of Live.js from [dreua's fork](https://github.com/dreua/LiveJS), ensuring compatibility and additional features.

Enjoy seamless and automatic live reloading for your localhost development with this Tampermonkey user script!
